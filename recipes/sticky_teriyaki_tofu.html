    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This sticky teriyaki tofu is my favourite tofu recipe ever – so easy to make, but such an incredible flavour! This dish will convert any tofu hater.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>400 g (~ 14 oz) extra firm tofu, pressed and cut into bitesize pieces</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic (I used garlic paste)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp minced ginger (I used ginger paste)</li>
            <li>4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mirin or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Chinese five spice</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a dash of oil in a large frying pan, and add the pieces of tofu. Cook over a medium heat for around 10 minutes, turning the tofu over ever few minutes, until it’s crispy all over. You actually want to cook it until it’s a bit too dry, as it will rehydrate once the sauce is added.</li>
            <li>When the tofu is very dry and crispy, add the minced garlic and ginger. Cook for 1 more minute, then add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a simmer, and cook for a few more minutes until the sauce has become thick and sticky. If you want a slightly saucier dish, you can add a dash more water (or a little more of any of the sauce ingredients).</li>
            <li>Best served straight away.</li>
        </ol>
