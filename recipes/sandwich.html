    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Use tofu as a substitute for egg along with dairy-free mayo to make these vegan sandwiches. They're ideal for a kids' party where some children may have an intolerance or allergy</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>400g block of medium-firm tofu in water</li>
            <li>6 tbsp vegan mayo</li>
            <li>½ tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>¼ tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>2 tsp finely chopped chives</li>
            <li>1 large white sandwich or wholemeal loaf (10-12 slices), or 12 mini rolls (use gluten-free bread if necessary)</li>
            <li>1 punnet cress (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Remove the tofu from the pack and press out the excess water, either between sheets of kitchen paper or a clean tea towel, weighed down with a plate for about 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Mix the mayo, mustard, turmeric and nutritional yeast together with a little salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Crumble the tofu into a bowl, leaving large chunks to create a chopped egg texture. Gently stir in the chives. If you want it looser you can add more mayo.</li>
            <li>Spread the mixture on the bread to make four or five rounds of sandwiches (depending on how much filling you want), then add cress, if you like. Use a sharp knife to cut into triangles.</li>
        </ol>
