# odin-recipes

The current project is a step in the fundamentals process of The Odin Project.

So far, I've created a repo on GitHub, cloned the repo and begun modifying the README.md

At this point, I have created HTML documents containing food recipes, linked these pages to an index and added images to help describe the recipes.
